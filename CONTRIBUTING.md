# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to make Terminal applications even better for everyone. It is a small project and you might already have a few (or a lot of) ideas on how to make it better for everyone but, before you start, take a few minutes to read  this guide will give you an overview on how you can help.

## Handling Issues

Issues might be the best point to begin contributing to the framework. Feel free to create issues for ideas you might have for enhancing the framework or even if just to notify other of a problem you found that might be worth of attention. You may also join the conversation on any issues by providing your view and perception of things and even help solve issues others might be facing while using Terminal.

However you chose to take part, just remember to always keep the conversation in a friendly and respectable tone. I have a philosophy of respect and tolerance for people don't come out of a mold, thus avoid bringing up topics that have no relation with the framework and definitely don't take part in flame wars should they arise.

## Documentation

The entire documentation for this framework is located on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Lmpessoa/Terminal/wiki) section of this project. If you believe some of it may be outdated, missing or even misleading, feel free to open an issue reporting what is wrong or can be made better.

Even though I try to keep it up-to-date when fixing or changing code, the source code may also suffer from being out-of-date. Please follow the guidelines on the section [Evolving the Code]() below on how to contributing with the source docs.


## Evolving the Code

The best recommended way to make changes to the source code is to create a fork and submit your changes in a pull request. This will tell me you have issues to fix on the code and I will try and review it as soon as possible.

However, although you can at any time fork-fix-submit, I believe it is a good practice to open an issue regarding the changes you want to make before you start. It helps not having people working on the same issue at the same time and enable others to take part in communicating over the issue thus it is also a good practice to listen and discuss any issue before implementation, just keep discussions on a respectable level.

I follow a very peculiar and different linting for my C# code but most can be resumed to not breaking line before a new block (i.e. '{' are always on the same line as the previous declaration). It does not mean your pull request will be rejected if you don't follow it strictly but I may have to spend a few more time fixing it before merging.

Just remember any contributions you make to code on a pull request and gifted to the project and will thereby be covered by the MIT license.

### To-Do List

Although usable, there are a few issues I'd like myself to work to enhance the Terminal toolkit and although I may tackle these issues in the future, any help is appreciated on them: 

* Enhance masks to support using literals and maybe input alignment.
* There are methods in-place to enable setting the size of the window occupied by the application but they are doing nothing right now.
* Enable linking multiple text fields to behave as a single text field spanning multiple lines
* It seems SSH applications can transfer files, but I have no idea how that is done.
* Code reviews and optimisations are always welcome.
